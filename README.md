## Hi there, welcome to my github profile 👋

✨ About me ✨ 

- 🌱 I am a FullStack Trainee Developer with a unique combination of technical expertise and creative vision. After 8 years of experience as a graphic designer, including leading a design team, I discovered my passion for programming, which has become my new professional focus.
- 🏆My goal at this moment is to continue improving my FullStack development skills and to learn Python.

- 🏀 My hobbies include reading books, playing basketball, and traveling.
- 💎 Fun fact: I have my own collection of stones and crystals. So, from my travels, I always bring with me not a magnet but a stone instead.
